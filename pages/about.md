# About the Exhibit

**After the Storm: Collier County and Hurricane Donna** is a digital exhibition that explores how Southwest Florida’s communities responded to and rebuilt after the devastation of Hurricane Donna in September 1960.

Drawing from the **Collier County Museum’s archives**, this exhibit presents photographs, government documents, and health department volumes that together tell a story of destruction, resilience, and renewal.
